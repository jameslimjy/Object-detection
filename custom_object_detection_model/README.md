# custom_object_detection_model
This folder is used for step 1, Training a Custom Object Detection model, of this use case.

The instructions to do so can be found in `Custom_Object_Detection.py`.

The folder `scripts` contains helper scripts that will be used along the way in `Custom_Object_Detection.py`.

There is no requirements.txt file as the packages to be installed must follow a specific sequence in order to avoid conflict of different versions of dependencies. Since `Custom_Object_Detection.py` will eventually be run using Google Collab, the packages to be installed and their order is listed clearly in the script.
